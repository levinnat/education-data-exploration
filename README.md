## Current Questions
- Where are secondary schools struggling the most with low graduation rates?
- Are these schools clustered in particular regions?
## Future Questions
- Are these graduation rates correlated with particular socioeconomic/demographic categories?
- What are the regions with high graduation rates doing differently?
- How have these graduation rates shifted over time?

## Steps to Run
1. Execute cells in the GraduationRateMap notebook sequentially.
2. Final cell will host a local interactive Dash application where the data is visualized.
